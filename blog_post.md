# GPT-4o Mini: Revolutionizing Cost-Effective AI Solutions

The GPT-4o Mini by OpenAI is set to change the landscape of AI by providing a cost-effective yet powerful alternative to previous models. Designed to bring advanced AI capabilities within reach for more applications, GPT-4o Mini offers unprecedented affordability and performance.

## Unmatched Performance at a Lower Cost

GPT-4o Mini scores an impressive 82% on the MMLU benchmark, outperforming its predecessors and even GPT-4 in certain areas. It's priced at just 15 cents per million input tokens and 60 cents per million output tokens, making it significantly cheaper than GPT-3.5 Turbo.

The model is ideal for applications requiring multiple API calls, large context windows, and real-time interactions. It supports text and vision inputs and outputs, with future updates planned to include video and audio capabilities.

## Superior Textual Intelligence and Multimodal Reasoning

GPT-4o Mini surpasses other small models like Gemini Flash and Claude Haiku on academic benchmarks. It excels in reasoning tasks, math, and coding proficiency. For instance, it scores 87.0% on MGSM for math reasoning and 87.2% on HumanEval for coding performance.

## Built-in Safety Measures

Safety is a top priority for OpenAI. GPT-4o Mini incorporates robust safety measures, including filtering out harmful content during pre-training and using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for post-training alignment.

## Availability and Pricing

Developers can access GPT-4o Mini through various APIs, including the Assistants API and Chat Completions API. It's available to Free, Plus, and Team users in ChatGPT, with Enterprise access rolling out soon.

## Future Prospects

OpenAI is committed to continuously improving its models while reducing costs. The GPT-4o Mini is a step forward in making advanced AI more accessible and integrated into everyday applications.
